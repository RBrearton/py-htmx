## Q1: Evaluation of derivatives for a four-vector field

This question is all about practicing taking derivatives of a four-vector.
We're told that $F^\mu$ is given by

$$
F^\mu = 2X^\mu + K^\mu (\^\nu X_\nu)
$$

where $K^\mu$ is a constant four-vector, and

$$
X^\mu = \left( ct,\, x,\, y,\, z\right)
$$
